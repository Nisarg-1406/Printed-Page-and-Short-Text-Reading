## About Project
* This project is the computer vision part which is aiming for reading the printed pages and the short text using Tesseract OCR. It takes an input image and with the use of the algorithm it convert the image into text. It gives the correct output on the printed pages as well as on the short Printed Text.

## Detailed Explanation about Project
1. It is using the Tesseract OCR library. Tesseract is an OCR engine with support for unicode and the ability to recognize more than 100 languages out of the box. It can be trained to recognize other languages. Tesseract is finding templates in pixels, letters, words and sentences. It uses two-step approach that calls adaptive recognition. It requires one data stage for character recognition, then the second stage to fulfil any letters, it wasn’t earlier Processed. This can be achieved by - `!sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`. 

2. Then to install the **pytesseract** using `!pip install pytesseract` - The version number is : **pytesseract - 0.3.7**. Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images. Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. It can read all image types supported by the **Pillow and Leptonica imaging** libraries, including **jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others**. Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.
